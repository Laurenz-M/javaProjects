# javaProjects
This repo contains little, standalone Java-projects, that were created during practice of the language.

graphDeveration.java : This little program takes the equation of a mathematical graph and performs a deveration. The input of negative exponents is possible.
Example of a deveration: https://www.regaltutors.com/graphing-derivatives/

consoleTableTranslation.java : Code that replicates the 'console.table()' function that can be used in javascript to display an array of values in a specific manner.
Javascript docs for 'console.table()': https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/table

fibonacciNumbers.java : A simple and small script that proves one of the many properties of the fibonacci numbers. It proves that the combined value of a random section of fibonacci numbers with a length of 10 is equal to the 7th number of that section multiplied with 11.
